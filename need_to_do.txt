1:- Write a function  rightrot(x,n) that returns the value of the integer x rotated to the  right by n positions. 
2:- Write a function invert(x,p,n) that returns x with the n bits that begin at position p inverted (i.e., 1 changed into 0 and vice versa), leaving the others unchanged. 
3:-  Write a function setbits(x,p,n,y) that returns x with the n bits that begin at position p set to the rightmost n bits of y, leaving the other bits unchanged.
